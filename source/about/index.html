Graduated in CFD, I am now a research engineer at Inria. I acquired
extensive experience with simulation codes and I could consider the
lack of software engineering in their design. In particular, I noticed
that code's modularity was most of the time neglected. With my
collegues, we are involved in the design of a new paradigm for
numerical simulation offering modularity, efficiency and visibility
for researchers and engineers.
